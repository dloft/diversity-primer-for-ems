## What is this?

The goal of this document is to provide engineering managers with sufficient knowledge and tools to be able to improve the diversity of their teams. "Diversity" in this context may include gender, race, ethnicity, age, sexual orientation, and/or life experience. Although most of the references here focus on gender and race, we hope the lessons and techniques can be applied more broadly.

The target audience is engineering managers at small-to-medium (5 to 100 engineers) technology companies. Ideally, this document itself can be read in < 1 hour, though reviewing all the material we link to could take 1 day or more.

## Motivation - Why does this matter?

* ["It’s the right thing to do. Full stop."](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AGJaqQ0b8AE&t=18m32s) - Michael Lopp, Pinterest

* If you need further justification, there is research showing that improving diversity is likely to be better for your team and your company’s performance.

    * Research summary: [Impact of Gender Diversity on Business Performance](https://www.ncwit.org/resources/what-impact-gender-diversity-technology-business-performance-research-summary).

    * [Diversity Makes Us Smarter](http://www.scientificamerican.com/article/how-diversity-makes-us-smarter/) (Scientific American): "People who are different from one another in race, gender and other dimensions bring unique information and experiences to bear on the task at hand." "...the findings are clear: for groups that value innovation and new ideas, diversity helps."

* It’s also the law.

    * [Need a pointer to a discriminatory hiring backgrounder]

* And [the sooner you start](http://www.wired.com/2015/09/slack-trying-diverse-starting-early/), the better off you’ll be (Wired article on how Slack is approaching diversity hiring).

* Additional resources

    * [Diverse workforces are more innovative](http://www.theguardian.com/media-network/media-network-blog/2014/mar/27/diversity-innovation-startups-fortune-500-companies) (Guardian summary of McKinsey report)

## Before You Start

* Are you really committed to improving diversity? Is your company?

    * This needs to be pervasive from top to bottom or you will be fighting an (even more) uphill battle.

    * Make this an explicit goal for your team, get everyone involved (recruiting, interviewers, peer managers, your manager) to commit to it.

* Do you have the data you need? If not, get it.

    * Smaller companies: start with a spreadsheet.

    * Bigger companies: it’s time to get serious. NCWIT has advice on [Diversity Data Collection](https://www.ncwit.org/resources/recruiting-retaining-and-advancing-diverse-technical-workforce-data-collection-and). You can’t manage what you can’t measure.

* Solicit support if you need it, from peers, HR, managers.

    * [Diversity: The Elusive How](https://medium.com/tech-diversity-files/diversity-101-the-how-4f9d17567427) makes a strong case for the role of HR here.

## Sourcing Diverse Candidates

* If lack of diversity is a problem at your company, you’re probably already being lazy with your sourcing, e.g. only sourcing from "top universities", or focusing entirely on referrals.

    * You have to stop, or you risk perpetuating your lack of diversity.

    * Face it: you will have to do more work here than before.

    * But as you just learned, it’s worth it.

* Ditch the "top university" filter, especially for experienced candidates.

    * (Need a reference here to the fact that what university you went to doesn’t matter as much as we think, and less and less over time… I think Google has published something).

* Look to non-traditional sources. A great list from [Diversity 101](https://medium.com/tech-diversity-files/diversity-101-the-how-4f9d17567427):

    * Code2040, Hackbright, YesWeCode, HackTheHood, BlackGirlsCode, Code.org

    * [HBCU](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Historically_black_colleges_and_universities)s, [HSI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hispanic-serving_institution)s, women’s colleges, Tribal colleges, etc.

    * Try to leverage alumni, past colleagues, investors, etc. to help bootstrap relationships and build a pipeline.

    * Example: [How Etsy Grew Their Number Of Female Engineers by 500% in One Year](http://firstround.com/review/How-Etsy-Grew-their-Number-of-Female-Engineers-by-500-in-One-Year/).

* Referrals: be aware of network effects - this is another great reason to start early!

    * "[Three quarters of whites don’t have any non-white friends](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/wonk/wp/2014/08/25/three-quarters-of-whites-dont-have-any-non-white-friends/)" (Washington Post summary of a [PRRI survey](http://publicreligion.org/site/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/AVS-Topline-FINAL.pdf))

    * Conversely, if you focus on diversity early, you’re more likely to get referrals that aren’t just white males

    * Consider higher referral bonuses for diverse hires, [like Intel does](http://www.fastcompany.com/3049179/fast-feed/intel-will-award-double-referral-bonuses-for-diverse-hires).

* Resume review: another source of bias

    * Unconscious [gender bias in resume review](http://www.yalescientific.org/2013/02/john-vs-jennifer-a-battle-of-the-sexes/).

    * [And racial bias.](https://www.chicagobooth.edu/capideas/spring03/racialbias.html)

    * [And class bias.](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/on-leadership/wp/2015/09/29/in-the-u-k-deloitte-is-hiding-college-degrees-from-its-applicants-resumes/) 

* Improve the language in your job descriptions:

    * [https://www.ncwit.org/resources/ncwit-tips-writing-better-job-ads](https://www.ncwit.org/resources/ncwit-tips-writing-better-job-ads) 

    * textio.com

    * [http://joblint.org/](http://joblint.org/) 

* Stop caring about test scores and grades

    * Google showed they are [unrelated to job performance, except for new grads where there is only a slight correlation](http://www.nytimes.com/2013/06/20/business/in-head-hunting-big-data-may-not-be-such-a-big-deal.html?_r=0).

    * [Stereotype threat and the SAT](http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/pages/frontline/shows/sats/interviews/steele.html) 

## Interview Process

* Most interviews already suck, and not just for diversity but for talent in general (Link to data from Google and others here… brain teasers are useless, whiteboard interviews are unnatural, etc).

* Understand [Stereotype Threat](http://www.reducingstereotypethreat.org/definition.html) (need a better backgrounder here, this is too dense) and [Unconscious Bias](https://managingbias.fb.com/) (video from Facebook: about 1 hour).

* Need a clear and objective rubric for evaluating candidates

* Ditch lazy "culture fit" interviews. You can interview for culture fit, but make it objective and not “do I want to have a beer with this person”.

* Recognize that [not everyone can afford to work on outside projects](https://medium.com/@amyngyn/the-impact-of-diversity-on-everything-b82e71140290), or publish reams of code to Github.

* Other ideas/examples:

    * [Want to hire more diverse people? Raise your bar.](https://medium.com/inclusion-insights/want-to-hire-more-diverse-people-raise-your-bar-b5d30f91cbd9#.jztuhs7iq) (Joelle Emerson on Medium)

    * Consider something like the NFL’s "Rooney Rule" - require at least 1 diverse candidate interviewed for each open position, particularly for leadership roles.

    * Soundcloud decided that diverse candidates would not count against headcount (need reference).

    * There are more and more tools to help reduce bias in the interview process, for example "blind" online testing: [https://www.gapjumpers.me/](https://www.gapjumpers.me/) 

    * Interviewing for [humility, not success](http://mobile.nytimes.com/2014/02/23/opinion/sunday/friedman-how-to-get-a-job-at-google.html?_r=1&referrer=): "Successful bright people rarely experience failure, and so they don't learn how to learn from that failure"

    * Figure out what works for your team! Interview process should be a careful, conscious choice, not just "what company X does".

* "Targeting vs. tokenism". Make sure that you have a sustained commitment to building and maintaining diversity and don’t slack off after the first hire. Great discussion of the difference in this [Startup podcast](https://gimletmedia.com/episode/19-diversity-report/).

## Work Environment

* Hiring for diversity doesn’t matter if your work environment leads to higher attrition.

* Educate yourself and your team about Unconscious Bias

    * Google’s [Unconscious Bias training](https://rework.withgoogle.com/guides/unbiasing-raise-awareness/steps/introduction/).

* Stereotype Threat, revisited

* The need for HR is well covered in [Diversity: the Elusive HOW](https://medium.com/tech-diversity-files/diversity-101-the-how-4f9d17567427) (along with a lot of other great material).

* Audit your [office environment](https://www.ncwit.org/resources/ncwit-tips-startup-members/ncwit-tips-startup-members-issue-1).

    * Does it look like a man cave? Did you know that having stereotypically male decor (e.g. Star Trek posters) can have a [negative effect on retention of female participants](http://sciencewithart.ijs.si/pdf/How%20stereotypical%20cues%20impact%20gender%20participation%20in%20computer%20science.pdf)? Even if they like Star Trek!

    * Lots of companies tout their amazingly well-stocked beer selection in their recruiting spiels, but how would you feel working there if you were an alcoholic or a child of alcoholic parents? Or a devout Muslim or Mormon?

* Are "team bonding" activities equally available to all employees? Doing these outside normal work hours can be difficult for those with kids or other life responsibilities.

* Related: does your company offer WFH/Flex-time for those who may struggle with a 9-5pm (or 10am-10pm) work schedule?

* Resources

    * Clef open-sourced its inclusion-oriented [employee handbook](https://github.com/clef/handbook).

## Career Development and Retention

* Women ask for promotions later than men (TODO: source)

* Compensation

    * Consider [ending compensation negotiation](http://www.fastcompany.com/3044928/hit-the-ground-running/what-other-leaders-think-about-reddits-end-to-salary-negotiations).

    * More controversial: consider an [open salary policy](http://techcrunch.com/2015/03/21/why-an-open-salary-policy-always-beats-secrecy/).

* Family Leave policies

* Mental health, crisis counseling -- do you think events like Ferguson affected your white employees the same way it affected your black employees? It’s not easy to "call in black".

## Leadership

* Impact of diverse leadership in attracting and retaining a diverse workforce.

* Don’t just approach the problem "bottom up" with diverse entry-level hires, you may need to make a concerted effort to promote or hire for leadership roles.

## Off-boarding

* Each person who leaves is an opportunity to learn. Make it safe to get clear and honest feedback.

* Another area where data collection is important. Collect, analyze, look for problematic patterns (e.g. especially poor retention in certain orgs).

* Look at both regretted and non-regretted. High regretted attrition could indicate a problem with inclusiveness; non-regretted subtle biases at play in promotion/evaluation as well as 'culture fit' (and possibly hiring).

* If the departure is regretted, follow up in 6 months and see if you can get them back!

## Conclusion

* There is a lot to learn here. But please consider whether the lack of training in this area is one of the reasons the tech industry is under fire for its diversity numbers. You probably spent 4 years learning computer science, so how about a couple weeks learning about diversity and inclusive practices?

* (Commenters: please suggest things to remove or tighten up as much as things to add. I’d hate for this to be so long that it won’t be read.)
